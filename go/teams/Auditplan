HIPRI
handle boxAuditError in gui - check if it even works
Audit correctness tests.
NEEED WAY MORE LOGGING!
clean up box_audit.go
TEST for upgrade path - force reload
put the permanent in noclean
switch to OK with corruptions for release. - in TODO
skip for open team ...
we don't actually disable the audit when env disabled RN. should still do bg tasks?
REBASE

LOWPRI
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return an attempt's result regardless if retryable...or just some keybase1Audit{} that embds an Attempt
featureflag? - don't release
Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()

------------------
FIGURE Out this  cannot unmarshal into versioned error fml

We should probably have a separate error for ClientSideError and test that....wouldn't be caught at all fml

wow resets do NOT play well.
