handle boxAuditError in gui - check if it even works
switch to OK with corruptions for release. - in TODO one in jail and another in maybeGet
OK to ignore Nonce20 and etc?
CHECK code coverage.. and race?
TODOs in db.go...lock/release

LOWPRI
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return an attempt's result regardless if retryable...or just some keybase1Audit{} that embds an Attempt
cmds for getting history (i.e. need to make protocols for queue/jail)
Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()
Switch require.Equals order?
Decide when to break team load on reaudit failure

------------------

test implicit team + JAIL
investigate so many BOXAUD logs on startup
GET OTHERS to do full hej
