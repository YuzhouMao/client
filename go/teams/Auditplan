    TEST for upgrade path - force reload
    TEST upgrade for team that has never had a BSH
handle boxAuditError in gui - check if it even works
switch to OK with corruptions for release. - in TODO one in jail and another in maybeGet
OK to ignore Nonce20 and etc?
CHECK code coverage.. and race?
TODOs in db.go...lock/release
maybe lower the schedulers for realz and check that they work

LOWPRI
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return an attempt's result regardless if retryable...or just some keybase1Audit{} that embds an Attempt
cmds for getting history (i.e. need to make protocols for queue/jail)
Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()
Switch require.Equals?

------------------

Decide when to break team load on reaudit failure

test implicit team + JAIG

ek_lib deadlock
rotate deadlock while in jail

and a subteam with impteams

AssertUnjailedOrReaudit doesn't need lock on teamID unless actually in jail

Check that outside of a box audit, reaudit actually does work on normal team load with no context
investigate so many BOXAUD logs on startup

GET OTHERS to do full hej
