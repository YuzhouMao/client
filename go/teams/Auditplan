handle boxAuditError in gui - check if it even works
Audit correctness tests - the summary calculators!
clean up box_audit.go - calculators

LOWPRI
I wonder if we need some way for TeamBoxAudit to return an attempt's result regardless if retryable...or just some keybase1Audit{} that embds an Attempt
featureflag? - don't release
Maybe ServerMal functions have a special suffix or opposite (Suspicious? or different err type...:()

------------------
FIGURE Out this  cannot unmarshal into versioned error fml

We should probably have a separate error for ClientSideError and test that....wouldn't be caught at all by tests fml

wow resets do NOT play well.

BTW need to check LRU Cache is OK, in addition to the DB...
And also should check that other public methods...fml
and maybe some private ones
OPEN TEAM TEST
